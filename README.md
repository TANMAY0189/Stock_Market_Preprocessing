# <center>STOCK MARKET PREPROCESSING</center>
- This is a freelance project (April,2020) done for a Pune based Stock Market firm.
- The project was about preprocessing stock values as desired by creating customized Jupyter Notebooks.

## <center>File Descriptions</center> 
- **STOCK_MARKET_PREPROCESSING** folder has a total of 3 files inside.
- **sample_data.xlsx** is the dataset that you can try for executing the Jupyter Notebooks.
- **STOCK_MARKET_ANALYSIS.ipynb** is the 1st notebook that generates csv files by creating combinations of stocks in sets of 1,2 & 3 which are then processed to calculate certain parameters.
- **STOCK_MARKET_ANALYSIS_WEEK_MONTH.ipynb** is the 2nd notebook that generates csv files by creating combinations of stocks in sets of 1,2,3,4,5,6 & 7 which are then processed to calculate certain parameters depending on daily, weekly and monthly stock values.

## <center>What You Will Learn</center>
- Extensive examples of Pandas library for preprocessing of dataset.
- Use of itertools and lists to create permutations of data as desired.
